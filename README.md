Built a 3D interactive temperature converter to experiment beyond basic UI and really explore how interaction affects user experience 🌡️

This project goes past simple form-based conversion and focuses on:
how motion, depth, and visual feedback can make even a small utility feel engaging.

From real-time temperature conversion (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin) to 3D card tilt and dynamic background color shifts based on cursor movement, the goal was to learn by pushing boundaries — not just making it “work”.

Small projects, big learnings. 🚀
Always open to feedback.
